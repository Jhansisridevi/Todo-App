# React Todo App with Tailwind CSS

This is a React.js Todo App with Tailwind CSS, featuring a list of todo items. Users can add, edit, mark as complete, and delete todos.

## Features

### 1. Todo List

- Each todo item is represented by a string listing a specific activity to be accomplished.

### 2. Todo Item Controls

- **Checkbox:** Indicates whether a todo is "complete" or not.

- **Delete Button:** Removes the todo item from the list. The delete button is disabled unless the todo is complete.

- **Edit Button:** Replaces the todo string with a text input for editing.

- **Save Button:** Saves the new todo string after editing.

### 3. Edit Mode

- When editing a todo, the text input is used to modify the todo content.

- "Delete" and "Edit" buttons are hidden during the edit mode.

- A "Save" button appears during edit mode, allowing users to save changes made to the todo within the text input.

### 4. Add New Todo

- An input element is provided to create and add new todo items.

- New todos are added to the top of the list visually, ensuring the latest todos are displayed first.
